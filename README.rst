Format specification:
---------------------
The central component of sharing information, i.e. status updates, with **twtxt** is a simple text file containing all the status updates of a single user. One status per line, each of which is equipped with an ISO 8601 date/time string followed by a TAB (\\t) to separate it from the actual text. A specific ordering of the statuses is not mandatory.

The file must be encoded with UTF-8, and must use LF (\\n) as line separators.

A status should consist of up to 140 characters, longer status updates are technically possible but discouraged. **twtxt** will warn the user if a newly composed status update exceeds this limit, and it will also shorten incoming status updates by default. Also note that a status may not contain any control characters.

Take a look at this example file:

.. code::

    2016-02-04T13:30+01	You can really go crazy here! ┐(ﾟ∀ﾟ)┌
    2016-02-01T11:00+01	This is just another example.
    2015-12-12T12:00+01	Fiat lux!
